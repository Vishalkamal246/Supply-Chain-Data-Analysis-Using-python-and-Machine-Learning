# Supply-Chain-Data-Analysis-Using-python-and-Machine-Learning
The global population continues to grow and change at different rates across countries and regions. Analyzing population data helps governments, organizations, and researchers understand demographic trends, plan resources, and address future challenges.
This project explores detailed world population data using Python and machine learning
techniques to uncover patterns, visualize historical trends, and lay the groundwork for
predictive modeling. By combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modeling, we
aim to show how data-driven insights can help forecast population changes, compare
regions, and support smarter planning for the future.
