# Supply-Chain-Data-Analysis-Using-python-and-Machine-Learning
In todayâ€™s competitive market, efficient supply chain management is essential for businesses to deliver
products on time, control costs, and meet customer expectations. Analyzing supply chain data helps
companies understand how products move from suppliers to customers, how inventory levels are
managed, and how various factors impact sales and revenue. This project explores supply chain data to
uncover useful insights that can support better decision-making and improve overall business
performance.
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze supply chain data and uncover patterns that
impact key business outcomes like revenue generation and operational efficiency. By applying data
cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, the project aims to identify which factors most
strongly affect sales and costs. With machine learning, businesses can move beyond simple descriptive
analysis to build predictive models that support smarter inventory planning, demand forecasting, and
production scheduling. This helps companies make data-driven decisions, reduce waste, and improve
overall supply chain performance.
