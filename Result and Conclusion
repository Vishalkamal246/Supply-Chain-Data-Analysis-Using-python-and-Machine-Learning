Trends & Insights:
• The global population has steadily increased from 1970 to 2022.
• Developing regions, especially in Asia and Africa, show high growth rates.
• Some developed countries in Europe show stable or negative growth.
• Countries with small land areas can have very high population densities.
• Visualization of growth rates shows which countries are expanding fastest and
which are shrinking.

Conclusion:
•The analysis shows clear differences in population trends across continents and
countries.
•High population growth will continue to challenge resource management and
urban planning.
